Image Color Theme Enhancement
-----------------------------

	This code takes an image selected by the user and changes the features of the image as directed by the given functions in the program. 
	It can also save the edited image.

1. Run the Main.m file.
	It will ask you to open an image. Also, I have added some test images on which I have worked. You can use those images.

2. Click on the given buttons to make changes in the image.
	You can use Histogram Equalisation for better quality of the image, and then save this equalised image for editing.

3. Click the save button to Save the image after achieving desired color theme or after eqaulisation.

Some time the editing takes a while due to the loops used in the code.
